# **Examples for DeGirum PySDK with Hailo Hardware**  

This folder contains multiple Jupyter Notebook examples demonstrating various AI inference use cases using DeGirum PySDK and Hailo hardware. Each notebook showcases different functionalities, from basic inference to advanced AI pipelines.  

## **Getting Started**  

To run these examples, ensure that you have:  
1. Installed the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
2. Set up your **virtual environment** and added it to Jupyter (as explained in the main [README](../README.md#2-create-a-virtual-environment)).  
3. Started Jupyter Notebook:  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Then, navigate to the `examples` folder in Jupyter and open any of the notebooks.

## **How to Modify Inference Settings**  

Each notebook is **pre-configured** with default inference settings, including:  
- **Inference host address** (`@local`, `localhost`, `@cloud`)  
- **Model zoo location** (`degirum/hailo`, `../models`)  
- **Target hardware** (`HAILORT/HAILO8L`, `HAILORT/HAILO8`)  

These values can be modified inside the notebooks if needed.
